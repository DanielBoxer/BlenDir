// The folder structure above would look like this:
// (SaveLocation is the folder where the blender file is saved)
// 
// SaveLocation -> RootFolder -> Folder1 -> SubFolder1A
// SaveLocation -> RootFolder -> Folder1 -> SubFolder1B
// SaveLocation -> RootFolder -> Folder2
// SaveLocation -> RootFolder -> Folder3
// 
//
// Keywords (case sensitive):
//
// "	" - adding a tab means a level of depth
//        -> use tabs to create subfolders
//        -> tabs have to be used, spaces won't work
//
// "*B" - where the blender file is moved to
//      -> add this somewhere in the line (ex. "FolderName*B")
//      -> if not added, the file will stay in or be moved to the parent of the root folder
//      -> this will be removed from the folder name before creating the folder
//      -> backup blender files will be moved too (.blend1, .blend2 ...)
//
// "*F" - will be replaced with the name of the blender file
//      -> ex. "FolderName_*F",  becomes "FolderName_FileName"
//
// "*X", "*Y", "*Z" - will be replaced with custom input from the UI
//
// "*D" - replaced with the current date
//
// "//" - this is a comment and will be skipped
//      -> empty lines are also skipped
//      -> the first line of the structure can't be empty or a comment
